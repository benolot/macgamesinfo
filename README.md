Tracking games on Mac and their availability. All of this data is sourced by hand, by humans.

If you have some data please [open an issue](https://github.com/benolot/macgamesinfo/issues/new/choose), email me [github@benolot.com](mailto:github@benolot.com) or even better, raise a pull request with a change adding a new row to the table.

[Find out if a game supports Apple Silicon](docs/SILICONSUPPORTFINDING.md)

Please please please do contribute with new data. We'll help make this better for everyone.

## Why?

I set this up one day over Christmas 2023 after being annoyed about finding if games support MacOS and Apple Silicon. There never seemed to be an easy to use source, so I figured I might as well make one.

## Code and contributing

This code has no licence. It's just some HTML. If making a PR or providing info via issue for a game you ackowledge that this is freely available information with no licence. There's no adverts, no profit, nothing. Just trying to help make information easier to find.

## Future goals

- Move site to a static site generator
- Hook generator up to a bot that generates a PR if an issue is raised matching the right template to make contributing data easier
- Generate a page per game to increase SEO and make it easier for people to just google the question "Does XYZ support MacOS?"
